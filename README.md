# nobita Flutter App

This repository contains a minimal Flutter application skeleton.

## App Functionality

When music or video is playing in the background, the app lets you
control playback with hardware buttons. Use a combination of the volume
keys and the lock button to pause or skip to the next track without
unlocking the device or looking at the screen.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Use `flutter run` to launch the app on an emulator or device.
